# SMART-WASTE-BIN-MONITORING-SYSTEM-FOR-EFFICIENT-WASTE-COLLECTION-
Kigali faces challenges in timely and efficient waste collection due to manual sorting and lack of real-time bin monitoring. This project proposes a smart system that classifies waste items and predicts bin content types using machine learning, enabling optimized collection routes and recycling strategies.
